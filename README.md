- Create class My_Application.Machine containing methods `public abstract void doWork()` and `public abstract void stopWork()`.  
- Create classes `My_Application.Truck`, `My_Application.Bulldozer`, `My_Application.Excavator` that will inherit from `My_Application.Machine`.
- In those classes override `doWork()`, so it will print message that certain machine started its work.
- Override `stopWork()` as well. It should print messages that certain machine stopped its work.
- In `My_Application.Main` class create `My_Application.Machine` array with `My_Application.Truck`, `My_Application.Bulldozer` and `My_Application.Excavator` and call methods `doWork()` and `stopWork()` in a loop.
